        "description": "Must-1: There is no perfect way to learn\n        Some will say, watch YouTube tutorials. Others might say, read those books. Someone else may say, read blogs on that website.\n        \n        I say, there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it, continue. If you don‚Äôt like it, Google it or search on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn. Once you have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to learn. So, don‚Äôt try to fit hard on other‚Äôs way, instead, build your own way to learn. That way, you will learn better!\n        \n        (If you like the first tip, press the clap icon üëè and hold it until it hits 50.)\n        \n        Must-2: Don‚Äôt listen to most of the people\n        Everyone will have a different opinion. Some people will try to discourage you. Don‚Äôt get frustrated or demotivated with that. Instead, take the positive advice, trash the negative one and move forward. Keep doing what you should do. Keep learning. Keep trying. I know you can do it. So, let‚Äôs do it.\n        \n        Must-3: Select a programming language, but don‚Äôt stick to it\n        In my journey, I started with PHP. After a few weeks, a friend of mine convinced me to switch to Java. Then, a teacher told to learn C#. After using C# in my first job for six months, I switched to Javascript. I used Javascript for 6 years, and then, last year I moved to Python.\n        \n        \n        Must-4: Your plan and timeline will not work\n        It doesn‚Äôt matter how robust your plan is, it will not work. Things will not get done according to your plan. So, don‚Äôt get frustrated. Just make sure that you are learning something new every day. Invest at least 2 to 4 hours every day. So, don‚Äôt go for plan, go for persuasion, patience and punctuality. If you can do it, no one can stop you.\n        \n        Must-5: Don‚Äôt just read or watch. Try it. Code it\n        Just reading blogs or books and watching video tutorials will not make you a programmer. Watching Karate movies, will not make you Jackie Chan. Instead, you have to practice. If you can‚Äôt install a code editor in your computer, search online code editor and use that. If you don‚Äôt have a laptop, use a mobile app like Programming Hero, SoloLearn or AIDE to practice coding. If you got stuck one way, there are nine other ways! üòä\n        \n        Must-6: Code small things first\n        Don‚Äôt try to change the world or make a billion-dollar company with your code in a short span of time. Nobody could. Just practice coding with 5 lines, or 10‚Äì20 lines. Build a calculator or a simple tic-tac-toe game (Bill Gates started with that!). Or, just try reversing string, joining arrays, finding elements, and code them again and again to become good at it!\n        \n        \n        Must-7. Don‚Äôt rely on others, rely on google\n        If you find someone else as your mentor or learning buddy, it‚Äôs great. However, don‚Äôt wait for them to guide you. Don‚Äôt wait for your learning buddy to explain you something. Instead, use Google. Google knows everything. If you don‚Äôt understand anything, Google it. If you are bored on one tutorial, search google for another‚Ä¶there are hundreds of them out there.\n        \n        Google Everything: Googling makes you wiser. So, whenever you have any doubt, concern, or curiosity ‚Äî just google it. Ask Google 10 times, before asking anyone else. If needed, change the search query and search again. The better you are googling anything, the better programmer you are. Then, you will discover sites like stackoverflow, quora, etc. which will open up a new world of helping friends.\n        \n        Must-8: It won‚Äôt be easy, but it‚Äôs not impossible\n        You won‚Äôt understand everything in a day, or a week, or a month to get a $80,000/year job. It will need time. It will needs hard work, dedication and consistency. It will need sweat. Once you have that level of effort, you will make it.\n        \n        However, it‚Äôs not impossible, millions of people have done this. Not everyone is smarter than you. Honestly, some less smart people also made it. If they can do it, you can do it as well.\n        \n        Don‚Äôt forget to press the clap icon üëè and hold it until it hits 50.\n        \n        Take Action\n        If you are a brand new programmer or at the intermediate level, try out this android app named Programming Hero. This is the best app to learn programming in a fun and interactive way.\n        \n        Also, feel free to reach out at programming.hero1@gmail.com‚Ä¶we will be happy to help you. We would like to hear if anything holding you back.\n        \n        Let‚Äôs win together. Let‚Äôs just do it!",

        "description": "Must-1: There is no perfect way to learn\n        Some will say, watch YouTube tutorials. Others might say, read those books. Someone else may say, read blogs on that website.\n        \n        I say, there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it, continue. If you don‚Äôt like it, Google it or search on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn. Once you have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to learn. So, don‚Äôt try to fit hard on other‚Äôs way, instead, build your own way to learn. That way, you will learn better!\n        \n        (If you like the first tip, press the clap icon üëè and hold it until it hits 50.)\n        \n        Must-2: Don‚Äôt listen to most of the people\n        Everyone will have a different opinion. Some people will try to discourage you. Don‚Äôt get frustrated or demotivated with that. Instead, take the positive advice, trash the negative one and move forward. Keep doing what you should do. Keep learning. Keep trying. I know you can do it. So, let‚Äôs do it.\n        \n        Must-3: Select a programming language, but don‚Äôt stick to it\n        In my journey, I started with PHP. After a few weeks, a friend of mine convinced me to switch to Java. Then, a teacher told to learn C#. After using C# in my first job for six months, I switched to Javascript. I used Javascript for 6 years, and then, last year I moved to Python.\n        \n        \n        Must-4: Your plan and timeline will not work\n        It doesn‚Äôt matter how robust your plan is, it will not work. Things will not get done according to your plan. So, don‚Äôt get frustrated. Just make sure that you are learning something new every day. Invest at least 2 to 4 hours every day. So, don‚Äôt go for plan, go for persuasion, patience and punctuality. If you can do it, no one can stop you.\n        \n        Must-5: Don‚Äôt just read or watch. Try it. Code it\n        Just reading blogs or books and watching video tutorials will not make you a programmer. Watching Karate movies, will not make you Jackie Chan. Instead, you have to practice. If you can‚Äôt install a code editor in your computer, search online code editor and use that. If you don‚Äôt have a laptop, use a mobile app like Programming Hero, SoloLearn or AIDE to practice coding. If you got stuck one way, there are nine other ways! üòä\n        \n        Must-6: Code small things first\n        Don‚Äôt try to change the world or make a billion-dollar company with your code in a short span of time. Nobody could. Just practice coding with 5 lines, or 10‚Äì20 lines. Build a calculator or a simple tic-tac-toe game (Bill Gates started with that!). Or, just try reversing string, joining arrays, finding elements, and code them again and again to become good at it!\n        \n        \n        Must-7. Don‚Äôt rely on others, rely on google\n        If you find someone else as your mentor or learning buddy, it‚Äôs great. However, don‚Äôt wait for them to guide you. Don‚Äôt wait for your learning buddy to explain you something. Instead, use Google. Google knows everything. If you don‚Äôt understand anything, Google it. If you are bored on one tutorial, search google for another‚Ä¶there are hundreds of them out there.\n        \n        Google Everything: Googling makes you wiser. So, whenever you have any doubt, concern, or curiosity ‚Äî just google it. Ask Google 10 times, before asking anyone else. If needed, change the search query and search again. The better you are googling anything, the better programmer you are. Then, you will discover sites like stackoverflow, quora, etc. which will open up a new world of helping friends.\n        \n        Must-8: It won‚Äôt be easy, but it‚Äôs not impossible\n        You won‚Äôt understand everything in a day, or a week, or a month to get a $80,000/year job. It will need time. It will needs hard work, dedication and consistency. It will need sweat. Once you have that level of effort, you will make it.\n        \n        However, it‚Äôs not impossible, millions of people have done this. Not everyone is smarter than you. Honestly, some less smart people also made it. If they can do it, you can do it as well.\n        \n        Don‚Äôt forget to press the clap icon üëè and hold it until it hits 50.\n        \n        Take Action\n        If you are a brand new programmer or at the intermediate level, try out this android app named Programming Hero.

        "description": "Must-1: There is no perfect way to learn\n        Some will say, watch YouTube tutorials. Others might say, read those books. Someone else may say, read blogs on that website.\n        \n        I say, there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it, continue. If you don‚Äôt like it, Google it or search on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn. Once you have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to learn. So, don‚Äôt try to fit hard on other‚Äôs way, instead, build your own way to learn. That way, you will learn better!\n        \n        (If you like the first tip, press the clap icon üëè and hold it until it hits 50.)\n        \n        Must-2: Don‚Äôt listen to most of the people\n        Everyone will have a different opinion. Some people will try to discourage you. Don‚Äôt get frustrated or demotivated with that. Instead, take the positive advice, trash the negative one and move forward. Keep doing what you should do. Keep learning. Keep trying. I know you can do it. So, let‚Äôs do it.\n        \n        Must-3: Select a programming language, but don‚Äôt stick to it\n        In my journey, I started with PHP. After a few weeks, a friend of mine convinced me to switch to Java. Then, a teacher told to learn C#. After using C# in my first job for six months, I switched to Javascript. I used Javascript for 6 years, and then, last year I moved to Python.\n        \n        \n        Must-4: Your plan and timeline will not work\n        It doesn‚Äôt matter how robust your plan is, it will not work. Things will not get done according to your plan. So, don‚Äôt get frustrated. Just make sure that you are learning something new every day. Invest at least 2 to 4 hours every day. So, don‚Äôt go for plan, go for persuasion, patience and punctuality. If you can do it, no one can stop you.\n        \n        Must-5: Don‚Äôt just read or watch. Try it. Code it\n        Just reading blogs or books and watching video tutorials will not make you a programmer. Watching Karate movies, will not make you Jackie Chan. Instead, you have to practice. If you can‚Äôt install a code editor in your computer, search online code editor and use that. If you don‚Äôt have a laptop, use a mobile app like Programming Hero, SoloLearn or AIDE to practice coding. If you got stuck one way, there are nine other ways! üòä\n        \n        Must-6: Code small things first\n        Don‚Äôt try to change the world or make a billion-dollar company with your code in a short span of time. Nobody could. Just practice coding with 5 lines, or 10‚Äì20 lines. Build a calculator or a simple tic-tac-toe game (Bill Gates started with that!). Or, just try reversing string, joining arrays, finding elements, and code them again and again to become good at it!\n        \n        \n        Must-7. Don‚Äôt rely on others, rely on google\n        If you find someone else as your mentor or learning buddy, it‚Äôs great. However, don‚Äôt wait for them to guide you. Don‚Äôt wait for your learning buddy to explain you something. Instead, use Google. Google knows everything. If you don‚Äôt understand anything, Google it. If you are bored on one tutorial, search google for another‚Ä¶there are hundreds of them out there.\n        \n        Google Everything: Googling makes you wiser. So, whenever you have any doubt, concern, or curiosity ‚Äî just google it. Ask Google 10 times, before asking anyone else. If needed, change the search query and search again. The better you are googling anything, the better programmer you are. Then, you will discover sites like stackoverflow, quora, etc. which will open up a new world of helping friends.\n        \n        Must-8: It won‚Äôt be easy, but it‚Äôs not impossible\n        You won‚Äôt understand everything in a day, or a week, or a month to get a $80,000/year job. It will need time. It will needs hard work, dedication and consistency. It will need sweat. Once you have that level of effort, you will make it.\n        \n        However, it‚Äôs not impossible, millions of people have done this. Not everyone is smarter than you.

        "description": "Must-1: There is no perfect way to learn\n        Some will say, watch YouTube tutorials. Others might say, read those books. Someone else may say, read blogs on that website.\n        \n        I say, there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it, continue. If you don‚Äôt like it, Google it or search on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn. Once you have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to learn. So, don‚Äôt try to fit hard on other‚Äôs way, instead, build your own way to learn. That way, you will learn better!\n        \n        (If you like the first tip, press the clap icon üëè and hold it until it hits 50.)\n        \n        Must-2: Don‚Äôt listen to most of the people\n        Everyone will have a different opinion. Some people will try to discourage you. Don‚Äôt get frustrated or demotivated with that. Instead, take the positive advice, trash the negative one and move forward. Keep doing what you should do. Keep learning. Keep trying. I know you can do it. So, let‚Äôs do it.\n        \n        Must-3: Select a programming language, but don‚Äôt stick to it\n        In my journey, I started with PHP. After a few weeks, a friend of mine convinced me to switch to Java. Then, a teacher told to learn C#. After using C# in my first job for six months, I switched to Javascript. I used Javascript for 6 years, and then, last year I moved to Python.\n        \n        \n        Must-4: Your plan and timeline will not work\n        It doesn‚Äôt matter how robust your plan is, it will not work. Things will not get done according to your plan. So, don‚Äôt get frustrated. Just make sure that you are learning something new every day. Invest at least 2 to 4 hours every day. So, don‚Äôt go for plan, go for persuasion, patience and punctuality. If you can do it, no one can stop you.\n        \n        Must-5: Don‚Äôt just read or watch. Try it. Code it\n        Just reading blogs or books and watching video tutorials will not make you a programmer. Watching Karate movies, will not make you Jackie Chan. Instead, you have to practice. If you can‚Äôt install a code editor in your computer, search online code editor and use that. If you don‚Äôt have a laptop, use a mobile app like Programming Hero, SoloLearn or AIDE to practice coding. If you got stuck one way, there are nine other ways! üòä\n        \n        Must-6: Code small things first\n        Don‚Äôt try to change the world or make a billion-dollar company with your code in a short span of time. Nobody could. Just practice coding with 5 lines, or 10‚Äì20 lines. Build a calculator or a simple tic-tac-toe game (Bill Gates started with that!). Or, just try reversing string, joining arrays, finding elements, and code them again and again to become good at it!\n        \n        \n        Must-7. Don‚Äôt rely on others, rely on google\n        If you find someone else as your mentor or learning buddy, it‚Äôs great. However, don‚Äôt wait for them to guide you. Don‚Äôt wait for your learning buddy to explain you something. Instead, use Google. Google knows everything. If you don‚Äôt understand anything, Google it. If you are bored on one tutorial, search google for another‚Ä¶there are hundreds of them out there.\n        \n        Google Everything: Googling makes you wiser. So, whenever you have any doubt, concern, or curiosity ‚Äî just google it. Ask Google 10 times, before asking anyone else. If needed, change the search query and search again. The better you are googling anything, the better programmer you are. Then, you will discover sites like stackoverflow, quora, etc. which will open up a new world of helping friends.\n        \n        Must-8: It won‚Äôt be easy, but it‚Äôs not impossible\n        You won‚Äôt understand everything in a day, or a week, or a month to get a $80,000/year job. It will need time. It will needs hard work, dedication and consistency. It will need sweat. Once you have that level of effort, you will make it.\n        \n        However, it‚Äôs not impossible, millions of people have done this. Not everyone is smarter than you.
